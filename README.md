## üîç Overview

3MF (3D Manufacturing Format) is an open-source file format developed specifically for additive manufacturing/3D printing. Unlike older formats like STL, 3MF can store comprehensive data including geometry, materials, colors, and print settings in a single file. This repository catalogs AI tools and services to create, modify, and optimize 3MF files for 3D printing.

## üèÜ Top AI 3D Generators

Here are my picks for the top AI 3D generators:
* **Masterpiece X:** Best for ease of use
* **Rokoko Vision:** Best for real-time full-body motion capture
* **Spline:** Best for collaboration and team projects
* **Sloyd:** Best for customization
* **3DFY AI:** Best for gaming and architecture
* **Luma AI:** Best for artistic video generation
* **DeepMotion:** Best for full-body marker tracking
* **Ponzu:** Best for texture generation
* **NeROIC:** Best for capturing high-quality geometry

## üìä AI 3D Generator Comparison

The table below shows how the best AI 3D generators compare on price, along with my recommendations for use case and which of the model generators they support. There are primarily three model types:
* **Text-to-3D:** Generate 3D models from text descriptions; particularly useful in fields like architecture, design, or gaming.
* **Image-to-3D:** Convert 2D images into fully realized 3D models; used by professionals in industries like computer vision, virtual reality, and entertainment.
* **Video-to-3D:** Create 3D models from uploaded videos; commonly used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality.
