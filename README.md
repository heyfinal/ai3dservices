## üîç Overview

3MF (3D Manufacturing Format) is an open-source file format developed specifically for additive manufacturing/3D printing. Unlike older formats like STL, 3MF can store comprehensive data including geometry, materials, colors, and print settings in a single file. This repository catalogs AI tools and services to create, modify, and optimize 3MF files for 3D printing.
